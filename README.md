## ðŸ”§ Hardware Used

- Arduino Uno R3  
- Red LED  
- Yellow LED  
- Green LED  
- 220Î© Resistors (x3)  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper Wires  


---

## ðŸ§  Working Principle

The program simulates the working of a basic traffic light:
1. **Red LED** â€“ ON for 5 seconds  
2. **Yellow LED** â€“ ON for 2 seconds  
3. **Green LED** â€“ ON for 5 seconds  
4. Then repeats in a loop


## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

- Digital output control in Arduino  
- Delay functions and timing logic  
- Basics of traffic signal automation  
- Writing clean and understandable code

---

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements

- Add pedestrian crossing button  
- Use buzzer for audio indication  
- Simulate with real-time modules like RTC  
- Display countdown using 7-segment display or LCD
